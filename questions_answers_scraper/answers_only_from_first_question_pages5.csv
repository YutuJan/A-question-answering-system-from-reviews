Because you have an allergy you need to ask on particular menu items.  The owners are Korean and most korean restaurants do not use refined MSG in there foods anymore. (Some did about 25years ago).   But a comment for you is what about natural msg.  You may know that it is naturally found in seaweed and nori products.   Which is a bigger issue if you have allergies.  The white crystal form such as found in accent or other brands bothers me also but the natural occurring does not.  Just some thoughts.,Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining,2,Do they use MSG when preparing foods? I am allergic.
"You're not allergic. Tldr; there's msg in the food here. There is msg in all food and in your body. I'm a nurse and get this question often. 
----

Natural glutamates are found in all kinds of foods. If you were breast fed you consumed really high levels of msg as a baby. 

Also- it's an amino acid that naturally occurs in your body. You make msg all day everyday.  Four pounds of naturally occurring glutamate are found in muscles, in the brain, in kidneys, in the liver and in other organs and tissues.

The average adult consumes about 13 grams of glutamate each day from the protein in food, while intake of added MSG is around 1/2 gram. 

Foods with msg that aren't Asian:
Potato chips, frozen dinners, cold cuts, gravies, ranch dressing, salty flavored snacks, potatoes, broth, stock, peas, tomatoes and tomato juice, mushrooms, grapes, grape juice, and Parmesan cheese. 

You may have a sensitivity to something else; but it is not msg. It is impossible to avoid it.",Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining,1,Do they use MSG when preparing foods? I am allergic.
