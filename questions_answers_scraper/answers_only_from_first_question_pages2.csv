Just got a pool pod yesterday with the wife and we loved it. It was right on the lazy river and next to an entry point. For 50$ a great idea because you get the pod until closing at 6pm (check in early because they quick and first come first served usually takes the good ones fast). The pod requires an additional 50$ minimum for food and drink but honestly in Vegas heat  you'll be dying for frozen cocktails.

Not 100% sure but I think The price range $20-$25 depending when you plan to go. I would call ahead first,Bacchanal Buffet - Temporarily Closed,0,Is there a separate price for children?
"Prices do vary so I would call ahead. That being said, the last time I went I used the Groupon which was great and saved me about 45% of the bill. The last time I checked  kids 4 and under eat free. Kids 5 to 10 years of age are charged $20 less than the adult prices for weekday brunches, $28 less for weeknight dinners, $38 less than weekend dinners, and $30 less than adult prices for weekend brunch.

Please also know that the prices do not include tip or the 8.25% Las Vegas sales tax. As such, a normal (non-holiday) weekend gourmet dinner for two will set you back $140.70 after tax.

Lastly, during holidays such as Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc, Caesars Palace mixes up the menu and charges more. While varies based on the holiday, holiday pricing is typically $12 to $15 higher per meal than normal pricing. For example, on the most recent Thanksgiving Day, the 11 AM to 11 PM lunch/dinner buffet price was $79.99 per person.",Bacchanal Buffet - Temporarily Closed,0,Is there a separate price for children?

I have stayed in their 1 BR balcony suites many times. Great hotel. Tower 1 is the best. The sofa in the living room does fold out into a queen sized bed. Enjoy your stay!,The Signature at MGM Grand,0,"Does the hotel offer 2 queen beds? If not, I see on the pictures they have a sofa couch, does anyone know if it can be converted to a bed?"
Yes it does!,The Signature at MGM Grand,0,"Does the hotel offer 2 queen beds? If not, I see on the pictures they have a sofa couch, does anyone know if it can be converted to a bed?"
"It does.  The ""Penthouse"" suites are very nice. Once kind in the bedroom with a huge bathroom. The living room has the couch that converts to a bed.  It is not the most comfortable but will do.  The kitchen isn't too shaby too.  But the kitchen supplies are small. Good enough for about four people.",The Signature at MGM Grand,0,"Does the hotel offer 2 queen beds?

We didn't have a problem hearing our neighbor's TV.  We moved to several rooms during our stay from the 19th floor to the 20th floor to the 16th floor and all of the rooms were pretty quiet at night.  During the day the music from the pool area was really loud and we could clearly hear the song that was playing including the lyrics.,The LINQ Hotel & Casino - Temporarily Closed,0,Are the rooms walls thin in other words can you heat neighbors tv etc?

"We do offer a limited number of express passes everyday, as soon as our main line fills up.  This allows you to skip the line at the front... you may still have to wait for a short time to be seated.  Prices start at $25. We do raise the price as a means of control if too many people are opting for the express pass... if everyone skips the line, it just becomes a new line.
