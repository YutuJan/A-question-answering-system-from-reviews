"I've had wicked spoon a lot but I'm not a huge fan of the food.  I think it's somewhat bland or just salty.  I think you'd have a better tasting dining experience at Bardot.  But it also depends if you're going in a huge group, then the buffet might have something for everyone.  Hope that helps !",Wicked Spoon,0,"How is their weekday brunch for the money? I am going to be in the area on Tuesday and debating whether to spend $70 at bardot in Aria, or $65 at wicked spoon?"
"I went to Wicked Spoon for a weekday recently - it was definitely a good value for $38. The food was good - not perfect, not super-fancy, but very good. Service was excellent. Deserts were great. There is plenty of variety ranging from Egg Benedict to Poke, and I always liked their giant desert station. I am pretty sure you can come in for a very late brunch and get a dinner for the same price. 

Come in right after the opening or around the lunch rush - it is busy, but the food is super-fresh and gets replenished constantly. I've seen folks complaining that sometimes dishes aren't perfectly freshest, but that's a reality in any Buffett if you come in at let's say 3pm. 

Bardot is a French bistro with a purely French menu - it is also very good, but you don't get to pick and choose so many different dishes with such a variety. The choice is very subjective - I could see myself going to either one depending on what I feel like... it's not that one is so much better than another.",Wicked Spoon,0,"How is their weekday brunch for the money?
