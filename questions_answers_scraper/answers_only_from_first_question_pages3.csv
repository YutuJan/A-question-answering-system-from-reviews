"Hi Brad,

Typically we cook what we think will put us at a 3:30-4pm sell out time. Most days fatty brisket is down at 1pm give or take 20 minutes. About 75% of people order fatty brisket until it runs out so it goes quick. Lean will go about 40-45 minutes after that. Turkey is a total wild card which is odd. It either goes early or lasts nearly all day. Ribs typically are good until 2-3:30. Pastrami on Thursday can last 30 minutes or it can go all day. It just depends how many pounds people buy. Beef ribs on Friday and Saturday are the same. We normally cook 18-25 racks and they normally are down between 2pm and 4. 

I hope that answers it for you. We base what we cook off a two week average for sell out times. If it goes early or lasts all day we revise what we cook but unfortunately it works great some days and other days not so well. Unfortunately we haven't found a better way.

Thanks,

Im here in Vegas for another 4 days and want to go on this with a few girlfriends but unfortunately lost my Wallet with ID in it last night.
There are some off the way street parking down past but the easiest thing will be to just park at The Plaza and literally your there.,Fremont Street Experience,3,Free parking? At least within reasonable walking distance when you have a toddler. We're local but don't have ID's yet to get any free validation
There is some available but it's usually at least 2-3 blocks away. The metered parking in the lots is like $5 for 3 hours I believe.,Fremont Street Experience,1,Free parking?

"When we deciding how we were going to get to Fremont Street from the Stratosphere, we chose the transit system. We switched 2-3 buses but it was pretty easy if map it out.

We didn't want to end up finding parking far away and still have to walk far, plus you end up getting dropped off right at Fremont Street.",Fremont Street Experience,1,Free parking? At least within reasonable walking distance when you have a toddler. We're local but don't have ID's yet to get any free validation
"If you park at 425 E Fremont (parking structure), it caps out at $8 but incrementally goes up after the first hour ($2, $4, etc). 
Neonopolis underground parking is free the first hour, also caps out at $8 same method. 
There's some above ground lots around usually $5-$8. 
I don't personally recommend any of the hotels parking because they're higher than the ones above. 
Hope that helped.",Fremont Street Experience,2,Free parking? At least within reasonable walking distance when you have a toddler. We're local but don't have ID's yet to get any free validation

The Gourmet Friday and Saturday night buffets include a few extras which are not available during the less expensive weeknight dinner buffets.
