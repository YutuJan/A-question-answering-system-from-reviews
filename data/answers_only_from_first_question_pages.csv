Just got a pool pod yesterday with the wife and we loved it. It was right on the lazy river and next to an entry point. For 50$ a great idea because you get the pod until closing at 6pm (check in early because they quick and first come first served usually takes the good ones fast). The pod requires an additional 50$ minimum for food and drink but honestly in Vegas heat  you'll be dying for frozen cocktails. Only downside to our location was the nearest bathroom was across the river or wed have to walk across the whole pool area to reach the ones by the bar.,MGM Grand Hotel,4,Anyone get a cabana/private area at MGM grand? Thinking pool pod since it's just two people. Worth it to be close to the water? Thank you!
"Pod probably a better bet for two. Cabana is nice, but it's going to be a $500 food/drink minimum (I think that's right, maybe even more), definitely more than two are likely to spend.

"We haven't stayed in the cabana yet. However, there are Day beds near the pool. For the day beds, you have to spend at least $100 worth of food and drinks. This was in May 2017 and at the lazy river section. It was not busy. Summer time will probably be more. If you don't want to be in the hot sun and want to be under an umbrella shade and with padded cushion seats, the day bed is the way to go. Unless, you want your own cabana.

"I’ve rented Cabanas at the MGM Grand on multiple occasions, sometimes 2 at a time and it’s worth it, if you have the money to spend.  Be aware it will be pricey depending on the month, projected weekend crowd and location of the Cabana(s).  I like the ones in the back area surrounded by the trees. But, when it’s around 110+ degrees and you chilling in your Cabana, drinking/eating and everyone wondering who you are and how do I get one of those overpriced Cabanas.

Not 100% sure but I think The price range $20-$25 depending when you plan to go. I would call ahead first,Bacchanal Buffet - Temporarily Closed,0,Is there a separate price for children?
"Prices do vary so I would call ahead. That being said, the last time I went I used the Groupon which was great and saved me about 45% of the bill. The last time I checked  kids 4 and under eat free. Kids 5 to 10 years of age are charged $20 less than the adult prices for weekday brunches, $28 less for weeknight dinners, $38 less than weekend dinners, and $30 less than adult prices for weekend brunch.

Please also know that the prices do not include tip or the 8.25% Las Vegas sales tax. As such, a normal (non-holiday) weekend gourmet dinner for two will set you back $140.70 after tax.

Lastly, during holidays such as Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc, Caesars Palace mixes up the menu and charges more. While varies based on the holiday, holiday pricing is typically $12 to $15 higher per meal than normal pricing.

"Hi Brad,

Typically we cook what we think will put us at a 3:30-4pm sell out time. Most days fatty brisket is down at 1pm give or take 20 minutes. About 75% of people order fatty brisket until it runs out so it goes quick. Lean will go about 40-45 minutes after that. Turkey is a total wild card which is odd. It either goes early or lasts nearly all day. Ribs typically are good until 2-3:30. Pastrami on Thursday can last 30 minutes or it can go all day. It just depends how many pounds people buy. Beef ribs on Friday and Saturday are the same. We normally cook 18-25 racks and they normally are down between 2pm and 4. 

I hope that answers it for you. We base what we cook off a two week average for sell out times. If it goes early or lasts all day we revise what we cook but unfortunately it works great some days and other days not so well. Unfortunately we haven't found a better way.

Thanks,

I am going to be in the area on Tuesday and debating whether to spend $70 at bardot in Aria, or $65 at wicked spoon?"
"I went to Wicked Spoon for a weekday recently - it was definitely a good value for $38. The food was good - not perfect, not super-fancy, but very good. Service was excellent. Deserts were great. There is plenty of variety ranging from Egg Benedict to Poke, and I always liked their giant desert station. I am pretty sure you can come in for a very late brunch and get a dinner for the same price. 

Come in right after the opening or around the lunch rush - it is busy, but the food is super-fresh and gets replenished constantly. I've seen folks complaining that sometimes dishes aren't perfectly freshest, but that's a reality in any Buffett if you come in at let's say 3pm. 

Bardot is a French bistro with a purely French menu - it is also very good, but you don't get to pick and choose so many different dishes with such a variety.

Because you have an allergy you need to ask on particular menu items.  The owners are Korean and most korean restaurants do not use refined MSG in there foods anymore. (Some did about 25years ago).   But a comment for you is what about natural msg.  You may know that it is naturally found in seaweed and nori products.   Which is a bigger issue if you have allergies.  The white crystal form such as found in accent or other brands bothers me also but the natural occurring does not.  Just some thoughts.,Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining,2,Do they use MSG when preparing foods? I am allergic.
"You're not allergic. Tldr; there's msg in the food here. There is msg in all food and in your body. I'm a nurse and get this question often. 
----

Natural glutamates are found in all kinds of foods. If you were breast fed you consumed really high levels of msg as a baby. 

Also- it's an amino acid that naturally occurs in your body. You make msg all day everyday.  Four pounds of naturally occurring glutamate are found in muscles, in the brain, in kidneys, in the liver and in other organs and tissues.

The average adult consumes about 13 grams of glutamate each day from the protein in food, while intake of added MSG is around 1/2 gram. 

Foods with msg that aren't Asian:
Potato chips, frozen dinners, cold cuts, gravies, ranch dressing, salty flavored snacks, potatoes, broth, stock, peas, tomatoes and tomato juice, mushrooms, grapes, grape juice, and Parmesan cheese. 

You may have a sensitivity to something else; but it is not msg. It is impossible to avoid it.",Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining,1,Do they use MSG when preparing foods? I am allergic.
We are allergic to MSG as well.  Makes us sleepy for some reason.  Could not feel that effect after eating at Gangnam.  Don't take my experience as gospel.  Best to ask.,Gangnam Asian BBQ Dining,1,Do they use MSG when preparing foods? I am allergic.

But if you really want to the normal lunch time, the first 45mins and the last 60mins can avoid the long waiting line.",Wicked Spoon,2,When is the best time for lunch if I want to avoid waiting in the long line ?
